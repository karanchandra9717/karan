Section A consists of 20 questions of 1 mark each.

Let a and b be two positive integers such that a = p3q4 and b = p2q3, where p and q are prime numbers. If HCF(a, b) = pmqn and LCM(a, b) = prqs, then (m+n)(r+s)=

Let p be a prime number. The quadratic equation having its roots as factors of p is
x2 – px + q = 0
x2 – (p + 1)x + q = 0
x2 + (p + 1)x + p = 0
x2 – px + p + 1 = 0
If α
and β
are the zeros of a polynomial f(x) = px2 – 2x + 3p and α+β=αβ
, then p is
